# Amazon-Prime-Movies-TV-shows_Power-BI-report

ðŸš€ Just wrapped up building an Amazon Prime Movies & TV Shows Dashboard in Power BI!


## Project objective
 The main objective of this project was to analyze Amazon Prime's vast collection of Movies and TV Shows using Power BI by importing and transforming data from a CSV file.
 By utilizing Power Query for data cleaning and shaping, the project aimed to build a visually engaging report that allows users to explore trends, filter data through slicers, and gain a deeper understanding of the streaming platformâ€™s content library.
